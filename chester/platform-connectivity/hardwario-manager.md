## Scan List

When you open **HARDWARIO Manager**, you will see the **SCAN LIST** page. Here you will see nearby devices, which use Bluetooth-enabled applications.

Choose a device from the list to connect, or use a **QR code** button in the top right corner. This **QR code** feature can be used only if you already know the **BLE passkey** or your device is already paired with the phone. Otherwise, follow instructions from the next [Device Pairing](#device-pairing) chapter.

## Device Pairing

To manage your **CHESTER** device, you have to connect to it via Bluetooth. Every device has a **unique** pairing passkey, which you can obtain if you scan the QR on the back side of your device. Use your favorite QR scan app or camera app to read **QR code** on the back of the **CHESTER** device. This **QR code** will open a webpage that contains the **BLE passkey**, which you need to pair with your phone.

:::caution
You can't use the built-in QR code reader in **HARDWARIO Manager** app to get the BLE passkey. Use your favorite QR scan app or camera app to read **QR code** to get the BLE passkey to pair your device.
