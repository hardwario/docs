### Remote Support and Quick Assistance

A key advantage of the Chrome Terminal is its built-in **remote session** feature.  
Using **“Create Session”** (found in the **top-right corner**), our support team can quickly connect to your device for **fast remote troubleshooting and assistance**.

### How to Create a Remote Session

1. Click **“Create Session”** in the **top-right corner**.  
2. A **Session ID** will appear in the top-right corner (as shown in the screenshot below).  
3. Click the **Session ID** to copy the unique link to your clipboard.  
4. Send this link to the remote user/support engineer.  
5. Then the remote user/support engineer can open the link in **Google Chrome** to access your device remotely.
