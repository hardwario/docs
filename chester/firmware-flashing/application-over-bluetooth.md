# Application over Bluetooth

Please use [HARDWARIO Manager](../platform-connectivity/hardwario-manager.md) phone app and follow a [Firmware Update](../platform-connectivity/hardwario-manager.md#firmware-update) chapter.

:::caution

This method requires a functional Bluetooth-enabled application already running on the CHESTER device. If you cannot see CHESTER in the list of Bluetooth devices, you have to use the [J-Link method](./application-over-j-link.md).
