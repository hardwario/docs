## Flashing

Follow these steps to flash the **CHESTER-Z** firmware:

1. Open the **CHESTER** enclosure (6 screws from the bottom side).

   :::tip

   You don't need to unmount the **CHESTER-Z** board from the top cover. The **SWD** connector for **SEGGER J-Link** is available from the bottom side of the board.

   :::

1. In the top cover, on the **CHESTER-Z** board, find the 9-pin **SWD** connector.

1. Connect **SEGGER J-Link** and the 9-pin **SWD** connector using the flat cable.

   :::caution

   One of the wires on the flat cable between J-Link and CHESTER has red color. This red color denotes a **signal number 1**. This red-colored signal has to be oriented toward the white dot located next to the SWD connector on CHESTER-Z board. The same rule with the cable applies at the side of **SEGGER J-Link**.

   :::

1. Connect the **Micro-USB** cable to your computer and **SEGGER J-Link**.

1. Download the **CHESTER-Z** firmware package [**v1.4.0**](/download/hio-chester-z-v1.4.0.zip).

1. Unzip the downloaded package.

1. Open the **Terminal** application and switch to the directory with the unzipped package.

1. Start the flash procedure:

   <Tabs groupId="operating-system">

   <TabItem value="ubuntu" label="Ubuntu" default>

   ```
   ./flash.sh
   ```

   </TabItem>

   <TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">

   ```
   ./flash.sh
   ```

   </TabItem>

   <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

   ```
   flash.bat
   ```

   </TabItem>

   </Tabs>
