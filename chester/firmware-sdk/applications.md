# Applications

In the SDK subfolder `applications\`, you get access to the complete code of our [**Catalog Applications**](../catalog-applications/index.md). You can adjust the code to edit, add functionality, or develop your own based on the project structure.

We split the application functions into specific files. You don't need to follow this style. However, it is suggested that you can later easily reuse improved functionality from Catalog Applications in your code in the future.

## Project files

In the text below, we explain what each file in the project does.

## Application flow

### main.c
The code starts in `main.c` where the `app_init()` function is called. In this `app_init()` all other threads are created and all the `main.c` does after that is feeding the watchdog and blinking the LED.

### app_init.c
In this file, all the subsystems and hardware is initialized. Also, the red LED is turned on, and the code is waiting until the LTE Attach is successful. The red LED is turned off, and the code continues.

Important code is called in `app_work_init()`, which creates timers for sending reports and sampling/aggregating of the sensors.

### app_work.c

This file contains the main functionality and logic of the application.

Each periodic action (reporting, sampling, aggregation) has its own timer created. Timer handlers are called in interrupt context, so for each timer created by `K_TIMER_DEFINE` we have a corresponding worker created by `K_WORK_DEFINE`. This way we can call any functions from the worker and use delaying and blocking API.

In `app_work_init()`, the timers are set based on configuration options like `g_app_config.interval_sample`.

When the timer is triggered, the sampling or aggregating functions from `app_sensor.c` are called.
When the report timer is triggered, the `app_send()` function in `app_send.c` is called.

### app_sensor.c

If we look for example to CHESTER Clime `app_sensor.h` file, there are these functions for hygro sensor:

```
int app_sensor_hygro_sample(void);
int app_sensor_hygro_aggreg(void);
int app_sensor_hygro_clear(void);
```

These functions are called from the `app_work.c` workers.

Function with `*_sample` does measurement and adds measured value to its internal buffer (see `app_data_hygro` structure and `sample_*` arrays in `app_data.h`).

Function with `*_aggreg` does aggregation on measured data in the buffer. Computing minimum, maximum, average, and median values.
These 4 values are put together with current timestamp to the `app_data_hygro` structure to the `measurements` structure in `app_data.h`.

Function with `*_clear` is called immediately after the measured data are sent to make room for new aggregations. This function is called from `send_work_handler()`.

When the report timer is triggered the `app_send()` from `app_send.c` is called.

### app_send.c

This function in some applications splits based on LTE or LoRaWAN variants. See the `compose()` functions.

For LTE/NB-IoT the `app_cbor_encode()` function from `app_cbor.c` file is called. This function encodes all the data in measurement structures to CBOR and HARDWARIO Cloud
later converts this data to JSON representation.

For the LoRaWAN variant of the application we use `ctr_buf` functions to create LoRaWAN binary data. We do not use CBOR on LoRaWAN because the LoRaWAN payload should be really small in some specific regions. So we need maximal data efficiency.

## Adding new sensor

- Enable sensor in `prj.conf` or add shield in `CMakeLists.txt`
- Add sensor initialization to the `app_init()`
- Create sensor data structures for samples and measurements in `app_data.h`
- Create `*_sample`, `*_aggreg` and `*_clear` functions in `app_sensor.c/h`
- Use existing or create new timers in `app_work.c` that calls `app_sensor` functions above
- Call `*_clear` function in the `send_work_handler()`
- Create new YAML items in `codec/cbor-decoder.yaml` if necessary, regenerate `msg_key.h` file with `gen-msg-key.py`
- Upload updated codec to HARDWARIO Cloud with `hardwario cloud codec upload ...`
- Encode measured data to CBOR in `app_cbor.c`

## Adding new shell config option

- Add a new item to the `app_config` structure in `app_config.h`
- To set a different default value than zero/false, add initialization to `m_app_config_interim` in `app_config.c`
- Create new function `app_config_cmd_config_*` definition and implementation in the `app_config.c/h` files
- Add new shell command by adding `SHELL_CMD_ARG` to the `app_shell.c`
- Create and add a new print function to `app_config_cmd_config_show`, which is called when you type shell command `app config show`
- Add created variable to the list of save and loaded config options using `SETTINGS_SET_SCALAR` and `EXPORT_FUNC_SCALAR`
