# CHESTER Counter

:::warning

CHESTER Counter is replaced by [**CHESTER Control**](https://docs.hardwario.com/chester/catalog-applications/chester-control) which offers the same functionality.

:::

This article describes the core functionality, hardware description, default configuration, and example **JSON** messages for the catalog application **CHESTER Counter**.

:::caution

Some of the basics are not provided, as they are common for all CHESTER catalog applications. Please see:

- [**Getting started**](https://docs.hardwario.com/chester/getting-started/first-step) on how to connect device to Cloud.
- [**Common functionality**](https://docs.hardwario.com/chester/catalog-applications/common-functionality) to know how LED, button and network configuration works.
- [**Platform Management**](https://docs.hardwario.com/chester/category/platform-connectivity) on how to work with the interactive console.

:::

## Application Overview

The application **CHESTER Counter** is used to count pulses on eight digital inputs. They can be connected to a PLC/sensor output (NPN/PNP), push button, switch, relay, etc. The application counts the total number of pulses and also the number of pulses since the last report (configurable using the `interval-report` parameter).

## Application Variants

**CHESTER Counter** can be ordered in one of these variants:

### CHESTER Counter {#chester-counter}

The catalog **CHESTER Counter** hardware consists of the following ordering codes:

* `CHESTER-M-BCGLS` - Standard mainboard

* `CHESTER-X0B:A` - Input module (4 channels)

See [**Ordering Codes**](https://docs.hardwario.com/chester/ordering-codes) for more details.

Firmware build shield options: `ctr_lte ctr_x0_a`

### CHESTER Counter Z

The catalog **CHESTER Counter Z** hardware consists of the following ordering codes:

* `CHESTER-M-CGLS` - Standard mainboard

* `CHESTER-X0B:A` - Input module (4 channels)

* `CHESTER-Z1` - Backup module

See [**Ordering Codes**](https://docs.hardwario.com/chester/ordering-codes) for more details.

Firmware build shield options: `ctr_lte ctr_x0_a ctr_z`

## Backup

**CHESTER Counter Z** (equipped with **CHESTER-Z1**) can also report information on the backup battery and external DC power state.

* The current **battery voltage** and **external DC voltage** are sent in every report.

* When the DC power input changes, the timestamp of the change event is stored altogether with the **connected**/**disconnected** state, this information is buffered, and the buffer of the events is sent (at the latest) with the regular report (parameter `interval-report`).

* Optionally, DC power input changes to the **connected** (parameter `backup-report-connected`) or **disconnected** (parameter `backup-report-disconnected`) states can be reported **immediately** or with a configurable **delay** (parameter `event-report-delay`) to allow capturing multiple consequent input changes.

* The maximum number of reports per hour is configurable (parameter `event-report-rate`). The event throttling limits communication bandwidth and preserves the battery lifespan.

## Default Configuration

This is the default configuration (printed using the `app config show` command):

```
app config interval-sample 60
app config interval-report 1800
```

## Firmware

The latest firmware is available in Catalog Applications [Firmware chapter](https://docs.hardwario.com/chester/catalog-applications/catalog-applications#application-firmware).
