# CHESTER Scale

This article describes the core functionality, hardware description, and example **JSON** message of the catalog application **CHESTER Scale**.

:::caution

Some of the basics are not provided, as they are common for all CHESTER catalog applications. Please see:

- [**Getting started**](https://docs.hardwario.com/chester/getting-started/first-step) on how to connect device to Cloud.
- [**Common functionality**](common-functionality.md) to know how LED, button and network configuration works.
- [**Platform Management**](../category/platform-connectivity) on how to work with the interactive console.

:::

## Application Overview

**CHESTER Scale** is designed for wireless weight measurement using load cells. The application supports connecting multiple weight probes (up to 4 channels) and provides real-time weight data transmission via NB-IoT/LTE-M or LoRaWAN networks.

The device is ideal for:
- **Industrial storage tank monitoring** - Track fill levels of tanks, silos, or containers
- **Pallet and goods tracking** - Monitor weight changes in logistics and warehousing
- **Livestock weight monitoring** - Optimize feeding schedules and track animal health
- **Agricultural applications** - Beehive monitoring, feed storage, etc.

## Application Variants

**CHESTER Scale** can be ordered in one of these variants:

### CHESTER Scale {#chester-scale}

The catalog application **CHESTER Scale** measures weight from up to 4 load cell channels.

The hardware of this application consists of the following ordering codes:

* `CHESTER-M-BCGLS` - Standard mainboard
* `CHESTER-X3C:A` or `CHESTER-X3C:B` - Load cell interface (2 channels per module)
* `CHESTER-E2-LP` - Enclosure with SMA pigtail

See [**Ordering Codes**](../ordering-codes.md) for more details.

Firmware build shield options: `ctr_lrw ctr_lte ctr_x3_a` or `ctr_lrw ctr_lte ctr_x3_b`

### CHESTER Scale Z

The catalog application **CHESTER Scale Z** includes backup battery support for uninterrupted operation.

The hardware of this application consists of the following ordering codes:

* `CHESTER-M-BCGLS` - Standard mainboard
* `CHESTER-Z1` - Backup module
* `CHESTER-X3C:A` or `CHESTER-X3C:B` - Load cell interface (2 channels per module)
* `CHESTER-E2-LP` - Enclosure with SMA pigtail

See [**Ordering Codes**](../ordering-codes.md) for more details.

Firmware build shield options: `ctr_lrw ctr_lte ctr_x3_a ctr_z` or `ctr_lrw ctr_lte ctr_x3_b ctr_z`

## Measurement and Behavior

### Weight Measurement

- Weight sensors are **sampled** with a configurable period (parameter `interval-sample`).
- Samples are then **aggregated** in the configurable interval (parameter `interval-aggreg`). Minimum, maximum, average, and median are computed from buffered samples for each channel.
- Each aggregated value has its timestamp and are sent in a batch in a report interval period (parameter `interval-report`).
- The `weight-measurement-interval` parameter controls how often the weight measurement cycle runs.

### Channel Configuration

The application supports up to 4 weight measurement channels:
- **Channel A1** and **Channel A2** on slot A
- **Channel B1** and **Channel B2** on slot B

Each channel can be individually enabled or disabled.

### Backup (CHESTER Scale Z)

**CHESTER Scale Z** (equipped with **CHESTER-Z1**) can also report information on the backup battery and external DC power state.

* The current **battery voltage** and **external DC voltage** are sent in every report.
* When the DC power input changes, the timestamp of the change event is stored altogether with the **connected**/**disconnected** state, this information is buffered, and the buffer of the events is sent (at the latest) with the regular report.
* Optionally, DC power input changes can be reported **immediately** or with a configurable **delay** (parameter `event-report-delay`).
* The maximum number of reports per hour is configurable (parameter `event-report-rate`).

## Default Configuration

This is the default configuration (printed using the `app config show` command):

```
app config interval-report 900
app config interval-sample 60
app config interval-aggreg 300
app config weight-measurement-interval 60
app config channel-a1-active true
app config channel-a2-active true
app config channel-b1-active true
app config channel-b2-active true
```

When equipped with **backup** (CHESTER-Z1):

```
app config event-report-delay 1
app config event-report-rate 30
app config backup-report-connected true
app config backup-report-disconnected true
```

## Specific Commands

:::info

You can easily explore the whole command tree structure - start with the `help` command.

:::caution

To apply a new configuration, you need to call `config save`, which applies the new configuration parameters and reboots the device.
