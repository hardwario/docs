# CHESTER Current

This article describes the core functionality, hardware description, default configuration, example JSON message, and channel calibration of the catalog application **CHESTER Current**.

:::caution

Some of the basics are not provided, as they are common for all CHESTER catalog applications. Please see:

- [**Getting started**](https://docs.hardwario.com/chester/getting-started/first-step) on how to connect device to Cloud.
- [**Common functionality**](common-functionality.md) to know how LED, button and network configuration works.
- [**Platform Management**](../category/platform-connectivity) on how to work with the interactive console.

:::

## Application Overview

The application primarily targets non-invasive current measuring using the so-called **DC Current "Transformer"** (DCCT). It can measure up to 4 channels of both AC and DC currents. The current probes are clips around the measured line, which convert the magnetic flux (proportional to the electrical current) to a differential output voltage.

:::tip

The current probes require a 5 V power supply (generated using the boost converter on **CHESTER-K1**) during the measurement cycle. The boost converter and the power rails to each channel are software-controlled, so **CHESTER Current** can operate as a low-power device powered by the battery. Of course, the measurement interval plays a key role in the battery lifespan.

:::

Apart from the current measurements, the device can be configured (on demand) to measure up to 4 voltage channels (in single-ended mode). It can combine both current and voltage measurements (the total number of channels never exceeds number 4).

## Application Variants

**CHESTER Current** can be ordered in one of these variants:

### CHESTER Current {#chester-current}

The catalog **CHESTER Current** hardware consists of the following ordering codes:

* `CHESTER-M-CGLS` - Standard mainboard
* `CHESTER-K1-C1-C2-C3-C4` - 4x Diff. Input + 5 V Boost
* `CHESTER-E2-LP` - Enclosure with SMA pigtail

See [**Ordering Codes**](../ordering-codes.md) for more details.

Firmware build shield options: `ctr_k1 ctr_lte`

### CHESTER Current Z

The catalog **CHESTER Current Z** hardware consists of the following ordering codes:

* `CHESTER-M-CGLS` - Standard mainboard
* `CHESTER-K1-C1-C2-C3-C4` - 4x Diff. Input + 5 V Boost
* `CHESTER-Z1` - Backup module
* `CHESTER-E2-LP` - Enclosure with SMA pigtail

See [**Ordering Codes**](../ordering-codes.md) for more details.

Firmware build shield options: `ctr_k1 ctr_lte ctr_z`

### CHESTER Current 1W

The catalog application **CHESTER Current 1W** supports multiple external DS18B20 1-Wire temperature sensors.

The hardware of this application consists of the following ordering codes:

* `CHESTER-M-CGLS` - Standard mainboard
* `CHESTER-K1-C1-C2-C3-C4` - 4x Diff. Input + 5 V Boost
* `CHESTER-E2-LP` - Enclosure with SMA pigtail

See [**Ordering Codes**](../ordering-codes.md) for more details.

Firmware build shield options: `ctr_ds18b20 ctr_k1 ctr_lte`

### Probes

You can choose up to 4 current probes with the following current ranges:

* Maximum current **10 A**
* Maximum current **100 A**
* Maximum current **300 A**
* Maximum current **1.000 A**
* Maximum current **1.500 A**

:::caution

The current range is specified for the DC. If you design your system for the AC, you have to multiply the maximum expected AC by the coefficient of `1.42` (square root of two) to see if the current probe fits within the limit.

:::

## Application Behavior

For the wiring diagram to **CHESTER Current**, please follow the [**terminal block description**](../extension-modules/chester-k1.md) of the **CHESTER-K1** extension module.
The extension module **CHESTER-K1** use both slots **A** and **B**. So you use the corresponding terminals **A1** to **A8** and **B1** to **B8**.

### Analog

* The analog readings are sampled periodically (parameter `channel-interval-sample`). These readings are stored as a **buffer of samples**.

* The collected samples are **aggregated** periodically (parameter `channel-interval-aggreg`). The minimum, maximum, average, and median aggregates are computed from the buffered samples. These aggregated results are referred to as **measurements**.

* Each **measurement** has an associated timestamp. The buffer **measurements** are transferred as time-series data regularly (parameter `interval-report`).


### Backup

**CHESTER Current Z** (equipped with **CHESTER-Z1**) can also report information on the backup battery and external DC power state.

* The current **battery voltage** and **external DC voltage** are sent in every report.

* When the DC power input changes, the timestamp of the change event is stored altogether with the **connected**/**disconnected** state, this information is buffered, and the buffer of the events is sent (at the latest) with the regular report (parameter `interval-report`).

* Optionally, DC power input changes to the **connected** (parameter `backup-report-connected`) or **disconnected** (parameter `backup-report-disconnected`) states can be reported **immediately** or with a configurable **delay** (parameter `event-report-delay`) to allow capturing multiple consequent input changes.

* The maximum number of reports per hour is configurable (parameter `event-report-rate`). The event throttling limits communication bandwidth and preserves the battery lifespan.

:::caution

The next report interval is calculated at the beginning of the transmission cycle as the `interval-report` parameter (specified in seconds) ±20 % spread. This spread is intentionally random to avoid transmission aliasing for multiple devices operating in the same place (e.g., powered from a local DC line). If such a spread was not implemented, the device transmission could synchronously overlap.

## Channel Calibration

:::danger

When upgrading firmware from **v1.x.x** to version **v2.0.0 and newer** - it is necessary to [**backup configuration**](common-functionality.md#configuration-backup). In the case of using **CHESTER Current** also calibration data.

:::

:::caution

The following section is provided only for reference. Usually, the **CHESTER Current** devices are ordered altogether with the current probes, and **HARDWARIO** does the channel calibration for their customers in such a case.

:::

### Calibration System Overview

The calibration system uses **two-point linear interpolation** to convert raw mV readings to calibrated values (e.g., Amps, Watts, or any physical unit).

:::tip

Linear interpolation is defined by this formula for output calculation:

`calibrated = (y0 × (x1 - raw) + y1 × (raw - x0)) / (x1 - x0)`

Where:
- `x0`, `x1` = Raw mV values at calibration points
- `y0`, `y1` = Real physical values at calibration points
- `raw` = Current raw mV reading

:::

### Configuration Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Range | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `channel-active-1..4` | bool | true/false | false | Enable channel |
| `channel-differential-1..4` | bool | true/false | true | Differential mode |
| `channel-calib-x0-1..4` | float | -10000..10000 | 0 | Raw mV at point 0 |
| `channel-calib-x1-1..4` | float | -10000..10000 | 0 | Raw mV at point 1 |
| `channel-calib-y0-1..4` | float | -10000..10000 | 0 | Real value at point 0 |
| `channel-calib-y1-1..4` | float | -10000..10000 | 0 | Real value at point 1 |
| `channel-calib-mode-1..4` | enum | avg/rms | rms | Calibration mode |

### Calibration Procedure

#### Prerequisites

1. Connect the current sensor (e.g., CT clamp) to the CHESTER-K1 channel
2. Connect to CHESTER via RTT shell or USB console
3. Have a reference measurement device ready (multimeter, clamp meter)

#### Step-by-Step Calibration

##### 1. Enable the Channel

```shell
app config channel-active-1 true
```

##### 2. Set Calibration Mode

Choose `rms` for AC current transformers or `avg` for DC sensors:

```shell
channel 1 calib mode rms
```

##### 3. Verify Raw Reading

Read the current raw mV value:

```shell
channel 1 read
```

Output example:
```
Channel 1: avg=0.5 rms=1.2 mV (mode=rms, no calibration)
```

##### 4. Calibration Point 0 (Zero/Low Point)

Apply a known **low** current (e.g., 0 A) and set the calibration:

```shell
channel 1 calib set-0 0
```

This captures the current raw mV reading as `x0` and sets `y0 = 0`.

Output:
```
Channel 1: avg=0.5 rms=1.2 (using rms), point 0 set (x0=1.20, y0=0.00)
```

##### 5. Calibration Point 1 (High Point)

Apply a known **high** current (e.g., 10 A) and set the calibration:

```shell
channel 1 calib set-1 10
```

This captures the current raw mV reading as `x1` and sets `y1 = 10`.

Output:
```
Channel 1: avg=50.3 rms=71.5 (using rms), point 1 set (x1=71.50, y1=10.00)
```

##### 6. Verify Calibration

Read the channel to see calibrated output:

```shell
channel 1 read
```

Output:
```
Channel 1: avg=50.3 rms=71.5 mV (mode=rms, calibrated: 10.00)
```

##### 7. Show Calibration Parameters

```shell
channel 1 calib show
```

Output:
```
Channel 1 calibration: x0=1.20 y0=0.00, x1=71.50 y1=10.00, mode=rms
```

#### Reset Calibration

To clear calibration and return to raw mV output:

```shell
channel 1 calib reset
```

### Legacy Calibration Method

In **HARDWARIO**, we have a calibration kit for **CHESTER Current** made of several air-core coils with 10/50/100 turns.

#### Example Current Calibration (Legacy)

1. Measure the **zero-current offsets** and write them for each channel as the `x0` parameter

   :::tip

   Use the `sample` command to trigger the measurement.

   :::

1. Let's assume calibration of **100 A** current probe and pick the **100-turn coil**.

1. Set the laboratory power supply's current limit to **900 mA**, and connect the power supply to the coil.

1. **Clip the current probe** around the calibration coil.

1. Verify the current flowing to the coil using a **multimeter** connected in series.

1. Measure the channel, and write the reading as the `x1` value.

1. Set the `y1` parameter to the value `90000`.

   :::info

   The value represents the multiplication of the number of turns on the coil and the power supply's current limit - in this example `90000`.

   :::

1. Since we assumed a zero-current offset point, we can keep the `x0` parameter set as `0`.

1. Save the configuration data (using the `config save` command) and verify the applied calibrated values.
