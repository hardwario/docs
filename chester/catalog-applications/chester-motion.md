# CHESTER Motion

This article describes the core functionality, hardware description, and example **JSON** message of the catalog application **CHESTER Motion**.

:::caution

Some of the basics are not provided, as they are common for all CHESTER catalog applications. Please see:

## Application Overview

**CHESTER Motion** is a directional motion detection device that uses dual PIR sensors to detect and track movement direction (left-to-right and right-to-left). The application counts motion events with direction information, and sends aggregated telemetry data via LTE to the HARDWARIO Cloud.

**CHESTER Motion** is equipped with two PIR sensors to monitor the passage of individuals around the device, making it ideal for tracking foot traffic in factories, train stations, or retail environments. With wireless connectivity and long battery life, the device can be easily installed anywhere, including remote locations for monitoring protected natural areas.

Typical use cases:
- Monitor foot traffic in factory aisles, train stations, or retail spaces
- Track the movement of individuals in protected natural areas
- Enhance security and optimize operations by monitoring human presence in various environments
- Facilitate easy installation in remote or difficult-to-access locations due to its wireless design and battery longevity

### PIR Sensor (CHESTER-S3)

| Parameter | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Detection range | Up to 3 meters |
| Measurement angle | Max 80° |

## Measurement and Behavior

The application operates in a three-stage pipeline:

1. **Sampling** (controlled by `interval-sample`, default 60 seconds):
   - Reads internal thermometer (temperature)
   - Reads accelerometer (X, Y, Z axes and orientation)
   - Captures accumulated motion counts since the last sample into a motion sample buffer
   - Resets per-cycle motion counters after each sample

2. **Motion detection** (continuous, interrupt-driven):
   - The CHESTER-S3 module has two PIR sensor channels: **left** (L) and **right** (R)
   - When one channel detects motion, a **750 ms window** opens to detect the opposite channel
   - If the opposite channel fires within 750 ms, a directional movement event is recorded:
     - L then R = left-to-right movement (`motion_right`)
     - R then L = right-to-left movement (`motion_left`)
   - If the opposite channel does not fire within 750 ms, only a single-sensor detection is counted (`detect_left` or `detect_right`)

3. **Reporting** (controlled by `interval-report`, default 1800 seconds):
   - Encodes all collected data into CBOR format
   - Sends the report to the HARDWARIO Cloud via LTE
   - Up to **30 motion samples** can be buffered per reporting period
   - Motion sample counters reset after a successful send
   - Totalizers (lifetime counters) persist across reports and are never reset

:::info

A random jitter of 0-20% is added to the report interval to prevent multiple devices from transmitting simultaneously.

:::

- Motion detection sensitivity can be configured using preset modes (**low**, **medium**, **high**) or **individual** custom parameters.

### PIR Sensitivity Modes

The application offers three preset sensitivity modes and one custom mode:

**Low** — Provides highest false alarm resistance with slower detection:
- `motion-sens`: 32, `motion-blind`: 3 s, `motion-pulse`: 3, `motion-window`: 4 s

**Medium** (default) — Balanced ratio between detection speed and false alarm resistance:
- `motion-sens`: 64, `motion-blind`: 2 s, `motion-pulse`: 2, `motion-window`: 2 s

**High** — Fastest detection with highest sensitivity. Single pulse triggers detection immediately. Best for security systems or door sensors where immediate response is required:
- `motion-sens`: 128, `motion-blind`: 1 s, `motion-pulse`: 1, `motion-window`: 0 s

**Individual** — Allows manual adjustment of all four parameters for advanced control.

:::tip

The `motion-sens` parameter controls how strongly the sensor reacts to input. Higher values mean higher responsiveness.

### LED Behavior

| LED | Condition | Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Red | Initialization | On during startup, off when initialization is complete |
| Green | Service mode + LTE mode | Brief flash every 5 seconds |
| Yellow | Service mode + no mode | Brief flash every 5 seconds |
| Green | Service mode + left PIR trigger | 100 ms flash on left sensor detection |
| Red | Service mode + right PIR trigger | 100 ms flash on right sensor detection |
| Yellow | Button press | Pulses N times (N = number of clicks detected) |
| LOAD | 5-click button action | On for 2 minutes |

:::info

Service mode LED indicators are only active when `service-mode-enabled` is set to `true`.

:::

### Button Behavior

The INT button supports multi-click actions:

| Clicks | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1x | Send data to cloud immediately |
| 2x | Sample all sensors immediately |
| 3x | Sample all sensors + send data |
| 4x | Reboot the device |
| 5x | Turn on LOAD LED for 2 minutes (load indication) |

Each button press is acknowledged with yellow LED flashes corresponding to the number of detected clicks.

## Default Configuration

This is the default configuration (printed using the `app config show` command):

```
app config interval-sample 60
app config interval-report 1800
app config interval-poll 0
app config sensitivity medium
app config motion-sens 64
app config motion-blind 2
app config motion-pulse 2

```

## Specific Commands

:::info

You can easily explore the whole command tree structure - start with the `help` command.

:::

:::caution

To apply a new configuration, you need to call `config save`, which applies the new configuration parameters and reboots the device.

:::

Command to set the **operating mode**:

```
app config mode <none|lte>
```

Command to set **sample interval** in seconds:

```
app config interval-sample <1-86400>
```

Command to set **report interval** in seconds:

```
app config interval-report <30-86400>
```

```

Command to set **PIR sensitivity** preset:

When set to `individual`, you can fine-tune all four motion detection parameters below. In other modes, these parameters are set automatically by the preset.

:::

```
app config motion-sens <1-255>
```
