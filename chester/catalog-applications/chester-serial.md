# CHESTER Serial

This article describes the core functionality, hardware description, default configuration, and example **JSON** message of the catalog application **CHESTER Serial**.

:::caution

Some of the basics are not provided, as they are common for all CHESTER catalog applications. Please see:

- [**Getting started**](https://docs.hardwario.com/chester/getting-started/first-step) on how to connect device to Cloud.
- [**Common functionality**](common-functionality.md) to know how LED, button and network configuration works.
- [**Platform Management**](../category/platform-connectivity) on how to work with the interactive console.

:::

## Application Overview

**CHESTER Serial** is a universal application for industrial serial communications. It works as a flexible gateway for integrating industrial devices (sensors, energy meters) into the cloud via LTE-M/NB-IoT or LoRaWAN.

The application supports two communication interfaces, depending on the installed extension module:
* **RS-485** (with Module [**CHESTER-X2**](../extension-modules/chester-x2.md)) — Modbus RTU Master, multi-drop bus, up to 8 slave devices
* **RS-232** (with Module [**CHESTER-X12**](../extension-modules/chester-x12.md)) — point-to-point connection, 1 device

It supports 10 device types including energy meters, environmental sensors, and generic Modbus devices. Data is transmitted via LTE (CBOR encoding) or LoRaWAN (optimized binary encoding with multi-device packing).

## Application Variants

**CHESTER Serial** can be ordered in one of these variants:

### CHESTER Serial RS-485 {#chester-serial-rs-485}

This variant is equipped with the **CHESTER-X2** extension module. It is designed for standard industrial bus communication where multiple devices are connected in a daisy-chain topology.

* **Interface:** Non-isolated RS-485
* **Topology:** Multi-drop bus
* **Capacity:** Up to 8 Modbus RTU slave devices

The hardware of this application consists of the following ordering codes:

* `CHESTER-M-CGLS` - Standard mainboard
* `CHESTER-X2` - RS-485 interface module
* `CHESTER-X10` - External power input (5-28V DC)
* `CHESTER-E2-LP` - Enclosure with SMA pigtail

See [**Ordering Codes**](../ordering-codes.md) for more details.

### CHESTER Serial RS-232 {#chester-serial-rs-232}

This variant is equipped with the **CHESTER-X12** extension module. It is intended for point-to-point communication with a single peripheral device, legacy equipment, or sensors requiring a direct serial link.

* **Interface:** Non-isolated RS-232
* **Topology:** Point-to-point connection
* **Capacity:** Single device (1:1 connection)

The hardware of this application consists of the following ordering codes:

* `CHESTER-M-CGLS` - Standard mainboard
* `CHESTER-X12` - RS-232 interface module
* `CHESTER-E2-LP` - Enclosure with SMA pigtail

See [**Ordering Codes**](../ordering-codes.md) for more details.

:::caution

**CHESTER Serial** requires an external power supply (5–28 V DC) for continuous operation. Sensors and the serial interface are powered continuously.

## Application Behavior

### Modbus RTU Mode

In Modbus mode, CHESTER acts as the Modbus RTU Master and periodically polls all configured slave devices:

* Devices are **sampled** with a configurable period (parameter `interval-sample`).
* Collected measurements are sent in batch during the report interval (parameter `interval-report`).
* Up to **8 devices** can be configured simultaneously on the RS-485 bus.
* Supported Modbus functions: FC01, FC02, FC03, FC04, FC05, FC06, FC0F, and FC10.

### Transparent Mode

In Transparent mode, CHESTER acts as a bidirectional bridge between the serial port and the cloud:

* Data received on the serial line is forwarded to the cloud.
* Only one device can be connected (`device-0` slot only).
* Useful for debugging, legacy equipment, or non-standard protocols.

### LoRaWAN Multi-Device Packing

When using LoRaWAN, the application uses adaptive multi-device packing (Protocol v2) to optimize airtime:

* Dynamically queries the current Data Rate to determine available MTU.
* Batches multiple device readings into single uplinks where possible.
* First uplink contains system data (battery, temperature, accelerometer) plus device data.
* Subsequent uplinks contain only device data.

## Technical Specifications

| **Application Protocols** | Transparent (RAW), Modbus RTU |
| **Cloud Formats** | CBOR (LTE), Optimized Binary (LoRaWAN) |
| **Power Supply** | External source (5–28V DC) required |

## Specific Commands

:::info

You can easily explore the whole command tree structure — start with the `help` command.

:::

:::caution

To apply a new configuration, you need to call `config save`, which applies the new configuration parameters and reboots the device.

:::

### Action Commands

Command to **trigger sample** immediately (and store the result in the sample buffer):

```
sample
```

Command to **send data** immediately:

```
send
```

### Network Mode

Command to set the **communication mode**:

```
app config mode <none/lte/lrw>
```

### Reporting

Command to set **sample interval** in seconds:

```

```
app config interval-poll <0-86400>
```

### Serial Line

```
app config serial-mode <transparent/modbus>
```

Command to set **baud rate**:

```
app config serial-baudrate <1200-115200>
```

Command to set **data bits**:

```
app config serial-data-bits <7-9>
```

Command to set **parity**:

```
app config serial-parity <none/odd/even>
```

Command to set **stop bits**:

```
app config serial-stop-bits <1-2>
```

### Device Configuration

Configure device slots 0–7 using the format `type[,addr[,timeout]]`:

```
app config device-<n> "<type>,<addr>,<timeout>"
```

Where:
* `n` — device slot index (0–7)
* `type` — device type string (see Supported Devices table)
* `addr` — Modbus slave address (1–247), required in Modbus mode
* `timeout` — response timeout in seconds (default: 1)

**Example configurations:**

```
# Gavazzi EM111 single-phase meter at address 1
app config device-0 "em1xx,1,1"

# ORNO OR-WE-516 three-phase meter at address 2
app config device-1 "or_we_516,2,1"

# Schneider iEM3000 at address 10 with 3s timeout
app config device-2 "iem3000,10,3"

# MicroSENS CO2 sensor (RS-232, no address needed)
app config device-0 "microsens_180hs"

# Clear a device slot
app config device-3 ""
```

:::tip

In Modbus mode, the Modbus slave address is required for all devices. In Transparent mode, only `device-0` can be configured.

  <TabItem value="lora" label="LoRaWAN">

**CHESTER Serial** uses binary LoRaWAN payload encoding with Protocol v2 multi-device packing. The payload is compressed to fit within the LoRaWAN MTU (51–222 bytes depending on Data Rate). Multiple device readings are batched into single uplinks when possible.

The ChirpStack/TTN decoder is available in the `codec/cs-decoder.js` file. It supports both Protocol v1 (single-device, legacy) and Protocol v2 (multi-device packing).

:::info

Due to LoRaWAN payload size constraints, device values are encoded using **Float16** (IEEE 754 half-precision) format. The decoder automatically converts these back to full-precision values.
