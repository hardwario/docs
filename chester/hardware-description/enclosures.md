# Enclosures

Standard CHESTER housing comes in two colors - light grey and dark grey. The enclosure has dimensions of 130x175x45mm and is IP67 rated.

It can be mounted using:

* Screws through the mounting holes
* Special zip tie holders (pole is possible)
* Duck tape
* Double-sided sticker (e.g., 3M Dual-Lock)

You can also place the CHESTER device in an alternative enclosure. HARDWARIO produces carrier boards for larger housings - those can bring the benefit of bigger battery packs and other electrical interfaces. See the chapter **Power Management**.
