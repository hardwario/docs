# Connector Description

## Terminal Blocks Description

The terminal block signals are defined by placing extension **X** modules on the backside of the CHESTER mainboard.
You can find more information in the [Backside Modules](../extension-modules/index.md#backside-modules) chapter.

## Terminal Block Solder Bridges

When there are no extension modules in slot A or B, the 8-pin terminal blocks can be configured using solder bridges.

Terminal block pins can have these signals based on solder bridges:

- Terminals **A1-A8** and **B1-B8** can be connected to the GND.
- Terminals **A6, A3, B6, B3** can be connected to VDD
- Terminals **A5, A2, B5, B2** can be connected to DQ (1-Wire Bus).

### 1-Wire extension

This picture shows how to extend the 1-Wire bus to 8-pin terminal blocks A and B:

This picture shows the terminal blocks connection:

This table shows the connection of 1-Wire to terminal blocks and JST 8-pin connectors::

| Terminal BLOCK Position | Signal Name | Signal Description   |
| :---------------------: | :---------: | :------------------- |
|        A1 or B1         |    `GND`    | System ground signal |
|        A2 or B2         |    `DQ`     | 1-Wire Data          |
|        A3 or B3         |    `VDD`    | General purpose I/O  |
|        A4 or B4         |    `GND`    | System ground signal |
|        A5 or B5         |    `DQ`     | 1-Wire Data          |
|        A6 or B6         |    `VDD`    | General purpose I/O  |
|        A7 or B7         | `NC or GND` | Not connected or GND |
|        A8 or B8         | `NC or GND` | Not connected or GND |

## Backside Module

This section provides information on signal mapping for the two backside slots (A and B) on the **CHESTER** mainboard.

The backside slots use two rows of signals:

* **Top Row** (closer to the antenna)

  This signal row (with nine 2.54 mm distanced pins) provides power rails + digital signals with the signal definition in the table below.

* **Bottom Row** (closer to the terminal blocks)

  This signal row (with eight 2.54 mm distanced pins) directly connects to the terminal blocks, and their meaning is module-specific.

### Top Row Signals (Slot A)

:::caution

The following table lists the signals in the left-to-right order when you flip the board (slot A is on the right side).
