## Module Overview

CHESTER-X1 provides 8 independent 1-Wire channels allowing to connect digital  sensors ( e.g. Dallas DS18B20) or any othe 1-Wire peripheries. The module implements Maxim DS2482S-800+ interface and also 5V boost converter to support 5V 1-Wire peripheries.

| 2        | CH2         | Channel 2          |
| 3        | CH3         | Channel 3          |
| 4        | CH4         | Channel 4          |
| 5        | CH5         | Channel 5          |
| 6        | CH6         | Channel 6          |
| 7        | CH7         | Channel 7          |
| 8        | CH8         | Channel 8          |

## 1-Wire Parasitic Power Connection

CHESTER-X1 supports connection using parasitic powering method. In that case only 2 wires are necessery. In the parasitic mode 5.0V powwer supply is used. Standard 3 wire connection powering from VDD supports only 3.0V peripheries. This figure shows parasitic and standard powering method:
