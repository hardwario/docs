# Extension Modules

The CHESTER mainboard (CHESTER-M) includes these integrated interfaces and peripherals:

* I<sup>2</sup>C bus (also featuring Sparkfun Qwiic Connect System)
* 1-Wire bus (using hardware bus driver with strong pull-up capability)
* Digital I<sup>2</sup>C thermometer
* 3-axis MEMS accelerometer
* 8 MB NOR flash memory
* 3-color RGY LED
* Push-button

The core feature of the CHESTER system is its hardware flexibility provided by the wide range of extension modules. These modules are either soldered from the bottom of the mainboard (two slots A+B are available) or connected via system I2C bus (e.g., for modules installed in the enclosure top cover).

:::tip

On the CHESTER DevKit variant, it is possible to install extension modules designated for the backside of the mainboard via spring connectors. That will allow you to quickly swap the interfaces during the development cycle. However, for the real device deployment, it is strongly recommended to have the modules soldered directly to the mainboard (HARDWARIO does the soldering).

## Backside Modules

Backside modules (red modules in the picture below) further extend CHESTER functionality with more interfaces.
This extension is modular also in CHESTER-SDK development where each module has its own ZephyrRTOS driver for easy integration.

Placing **X** module in the left **"A"** slot connects its signals to the two left terminal blocks **TB1** and **TB2** (see the blue square in the picture below).
Both left terminal blocks **TB1** and **TB2** are wired together in parallel so you can more easily connect multiple sensors to the same signal/power.

The same applies to the right **"B"** slot and terminals **TB5** and **TB6** (see the green square in the picture below).

When CHESTER is mounted in the enclosure, you can check the module **"X_"** number and hardware revision **"R1.0"** through the small holes when the battery is removed (see the two orange circles in the image below).
