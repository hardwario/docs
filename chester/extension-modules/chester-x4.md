# CHESTER-X4

This article describes the CHESTER-X4 extension module.

## Module Overview
CHESTER-X4 implements a step-down DC/DC converter providing power from an external 6-28 VDC line (VIN). It allows also the input voltage measurement. This module has also 4 P-MOS switches allowing to supply of independent loads from VIN voltage input.

## Output Protection
Each of the four outputs has a resetable PTC fuse protection (femtoSMDC005F). Each output can **reliably supply 50 mA of constant current**. The trip current is around 150 mA.
