## CHESTER-X3A Module Overview

CHESTER-X3A provides 2 inputs for RTD (resistive temperature devices) sensors, such as Pt 100 and Pt 1000. Each input supports 4 wire sensor connection to improve the accuracy.

## CHESTER-X3B Module Overview

CHESTER-X3B allows connecting 2 type-K thermocouples (types B/C/E/J/N/R/S/T support on request) using 2 wire sensor connection.

First sensor connects to **CH1A(-)** and **CH1B(+)**.
If X3B is in the **slot A**, then you have to use terminals **A2(-)** and **A3(+)**.

The second sensor connects to **CH2A(-)** and **CH2B(+)**.
If X3B is in the **slot A**, then you have to use terminals **A6(-)** and **A7(+)**.

## CHESTER-X3C Module Overview

CHESTER-X3C provides 2 inputs for load-cell (strain gauge) that can be used for weight measurements. Each channel use 4 wire connection.

| 2        | CH1A        | Channel 1: sensor input A         |
| 3        | CH1B        | Channel 1: sensor input B         |
| 4        | CH1M        | Channel 1: sensor negative supply |
| 5        | CH2P        | Channel 2: sensor positive supply |
| 6        | CH2A        | Channel 2: sensor input A         |
| 7        | CH2B        | Channel 2: sensor input B         |
| 8        | CH2M        | Channel 2: sensor negative supply |

## Schematic diagram

A schematic diagram is useful if you program low-level hardware-related code or if you're just curious about how the system is designed.
