## CHESTER-X3A Module Overview

CHESTER-X3A provides 2 inputs for RTD (resistive temperature devices) sensors, such as Pt 100 and Pt 1000. Each input supports 4 wire sensor connection to improve the accurity.

## CHESTER-X3B Module Overview

CHESTER-X3B allow to connect 2 thermocouples (type B/C/E/J/K/N/R/S/T) using 4 wire sensor connection.

## CHESTER-X3C Module Overview

CHESTER-X3C provides 2 inputs for load-cell (strain gauge) that can be used for weight measurements. Each channel use 4 wire connection.
