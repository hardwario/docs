# CHESTER-B1
This article describes the **CHESTER-CB** carrier board.

## Module Overview

**CHESTER-B1** is a carrier board for **CHESTER-M** providing extra battery capacity for extend battery lifespan. It can be useful for application that needs long life time 5 - 10 years without battery replacement or for standard application thats requires short period of measuring and communication which is mor power consumption The following configurations are available:
- up to eight 3.6V lithium C cells (8P)
- up to eight 1.5V alkaline C cells (2S4P)
- up to six 3.6V D cell in parallel (6P)
- up to six 1.5V alkaline D cells (2S3P)

CHESTER-B1 with fits with the Takachi WP20-28-5Cx enclosure with C cell holders or Takachi WP20-28-57x with D cell holders.


## Technical Specification

* Input DC voltage range (VIN): **8-36 V**
* Supported C size battery: 1 x **Saft LSH14** or 1 x **Saft LS26500\***
* Up to 4 x C size or 3 x D size battery on request (Saft LSH20 or LS33000)
* Nominal battery voltage: **3.6 V**
* Battery idle current consumption **<2 Î¼A** (without **CHESTER-M**)

_\* Saft LS26500 cannot be used with CHESTER-M-E variant (without supercapacitors)._

For more details see [**Ordering Codes**](../ordering-codes.md#chester-m).
