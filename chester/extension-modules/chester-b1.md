# CHESTER-B1
This article describes the **CHESTER-CB** carrier board.

## Module Overview

**CHESTER-B1** is a carrier board for **CHESTER-M** providing extra battery capacity for extend battery lifespan. It can be useful for application that needs long life time 5 - 10 years without battery replacement or for standard application thats requires short period of measuring and communication which is mor power consumption. The following configurations are available:
- up to eight 3.6V lithium C cells (8P) providing 62 Ah (LS26500)
- up to eight 1.5V alkaline C cells (2S4P) providing 31 Ah (C VARTA)
- up to six 3.6V D cell in parallel (6P) providing 102 Ah (LS33600)
- up to six 1.5V alkaline D cells (2S3P) providing 50 Ah (D VARTA)

CHESTER-B1 with fits with the Takachi WP20-28-5Cx enclosure with C cell holders or Takachi WP20-28-57x with D cell holders.


## Technical Specification

* Supported C size 3.6V lithium battery: 1P-8P x **Saft LSH14** or 8P x **Saft LS26500\***
* Supported D size 3.6V lithium battery: 1P-6P x **Saft LSH20** or 6P x **Saft LS33600\****
* Supported C size 1.5V: standard alkaline battery in 2S4P configuration
* Supported D size 1.5V: standard alkaline battery in 2S3P configuration
* Battery idle current consumption **<2 Î¼A** (without **CHESTER-M**)

_\* Single Saft LS26500 cell is not able to deliver hight current peaks, install all 8 cells.
_\* Single Saft LS33600 cell is not able to deliver hight current peaks, install all 6 cells.
