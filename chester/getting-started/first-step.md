## Step 2: Create Your Space

1. In the top-right corner, click **SPACES → NEW SPACE**  
2. Name your space (for example: `my-home`, `office-sensors`, `warehouse`)

## Step 3: Add a Device

1. Select your **Space**  
2. Go to **DEVICES → +NEW DEVICE**  
3. Enter the information about your **CHESTER** — you can choose one of the following options:

   **Option 1 – Scan the QR Code:**  
   Use the **`⛶ SCAN DEVICE`** feature in the HARDWARIO Cloud to **scan the QR code** on your CHESTER — all the **information** will be **filled in automatically**!  

   **Option 2 – Manually:**  
   You can add a device manually by filling in the following fields:  
   - **Name**  
   - **HARDWARIO Serial Number (HSN)**  
   - **Claim Token**

:::info
The **Claim Token** is unique for each device — you can obtain it by **scanning the QR code** on the device with any QR code reader, or by using the **`info show`** command when the device is connected via **J-Link**.
:::


4. Save it — your CHESTER is now **registered in the Cloud**!

## Step 4: Power Up Your CHESTER

:::caution
> **Important:** Add the device to the Cloud **before powering it up.**  
> Otherwise, it might take longer (up to several hours) to connect.
:::

- Insert the batteries or connect an external power source  
- Wait a few minutes while your device connects to the HARDWARIO Cloud — the device will **blink the green LED** once it’s successfully connected  
  *(See LED behavior explained below in [Step 5: Check the Status LED](#step-5-check-the-status-led))*  
- If you are using an older **CHESTER-M** model with supercapacitors, wait about **30 seconds** after inserting the batteries — the capacitors need to charge before the LED starts blinking.  
- If it doesn’t connect, try one of these quick actions:

   🔹 **Press the button four times** → reboots the device  
   🔹 **Remove and reinsert the batteries**  
   🔹 For **CHESTER-M** (with blue supercapacitors):  
     - Hold the button or press it **five times** until the **white LED** turns on — this discharges the capacitors (takes ≈ 30 s)

---


## Step 5: Check the Status LED

- **Blinking green every 5 seconds** → Connected to HARDWARIO Cloud ✅  
- **No blinking /** [**other colors**](https://docs.hardwario.com/chester/catalog-applications/common-functionality/#led-behaviour) → Still connecting or an error occurred — check SIM, network coverage, or power  

:::info
For details about all LED color states and meanings, see the [**LED Behaviour documentation**](https://docs.hardwario.com/chester/catalog-applications/common-functionality/#led-behaviour).
:::

## Step 6: See Your Data in the Cloud

1. In [**HARDWARIO Cloud**](https://hardwario.cloud), open **DEVICES**  
2. Click the **chat icon** next to your device  
3. You’ll see **messages and live data** sent from CHESTER 🎉  

---

## Step 7: Configure Your Device

Once connected, you can:

- Send [**Config commands**](https://docs.hardwario.com/cloud/downlink#config) directly from the Cloud  
- Use [**HARDWARIO Manager**](https://docs.hardwario.com/chester/getting-started/hardwario-manager) (mobile app via BLE)  
- Use [**HARDWARIO Monitor**](https://docs.hardwario.com/chester/getting-started/hardwario-monitor) (USB J-Link or BLE from your PC)  
- Access a [**Remote shell**](https://docs.hardwario.com/cloud/downlink/#shell-commands) and even perform [**FOTA updates**](https://docs.hardwario.com/cloud/fota)

---

## Step 8: Check and Update CHESTER Firmware

It’s always a good idea to make sure your CHESTER is running the **latest firmware version**.

### Check Firmware Version
You can check it in two ways:

1. **Using** [**HARDWARIO Manager (mobile app)**](https://docs.hardwario.com/chester/getting-started/hardwario-manager)  
   - Open the app and connect to your CHESTER via Bluetooth  
   - The firmware version will be displayed automatically  

2. **Using** [**HARDWARIO Monitor (desktop app)**](https://docs.hardwario.com/chester/getting-started/hardwario-monitor)  
   - Connect CHESTER via USB or BLE  
   - Run the command:  
     ```bash
     info show
     ```
   - You’ll see firmware and application details in the console

### Download the Latest Firmware
You can always find the newest firmware builds here:  
👉 [**Available Application Firmware Builds**](https://docs.hardwario.com/chester/catalog-applications/catalog-applications#available-application-firmware-builds)

:::info
 The firmware table is organized by CHESTER type, so make sure to select the correct one for your device.
:::

### Update Firmware
If a newer version is available, you can update it using one of these methods:

1. **Update via [**HARDWARIO Manager  (mobile app)**](https://docs.hardwario.com/chester/getting-started/hardwario-manager)**

   - Follow this step-by-step guide: 👉 [**Firmware update using HARDWARIO Manager**](https://docs.hardwario.com/chester/platform-connectivity/hardwario-manager#firmware-update)

2. **Update Firmware from the Cloud ([**FOTA**](https://docs.hardwario.com/cloud/fota/))**
   - You can also update your CHESTER **remotely** via the cloud.

   - For full technical details, see this guide: 👉 [**FOTA documentation**](https://docs.hardwario.com/cloud/fota/). 

3. **Manual Update via [**J-Link (over USB)**](https://docs.hardwario.com/chester/firmware-flashing/application-over-j-link)**
   - If you prefer flashing manually, see this guide: 👉 [**Application update over J-Link**](https://docs.hardwario.com/chester/firmware-flashing/application-over-j-link)

---

✅ **That’s it!**  
Your CHESTER is now connected, configured, and up to date — ready to collect and send data to the cloud.

## Step 9: Explore Applications and Integrations

Your CHESTER can do much more than just send data!  
You can extend its functionality using [**HARDWARIO Applications**](https://docs.hardwario.com/apps/) — ready-made modules and tools that help you:

- 📊 **Visualize your data** using dashboards and charts  
- 🌐 **Integrate CHESTER** into existing **LoRaWAN networks** or other IoT systems  
- ⚙️ **Build automations and analytics** for your specific use case  

All applications are easy to deploy and can transform your CHESTER into a complete IoT solution.
