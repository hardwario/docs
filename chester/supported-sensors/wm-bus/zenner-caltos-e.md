### Mapping the wM-Bus Address to Chester

The mapping must be carried out using the **Chester terminal**, for example with:  

- [**Hardwario Monitor (Windows)**](https://github.com/hardwario/hio-monitor/releases)
- [**Hardwario Manager (Android)**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hardwario.manager)
- [**Google Chrome Terminal**](https://terminal.hardwario.com/)

### Managing and Adding wM-Bus Device Addresses in Chester

Here you can manage the list of **wM-Bus addresses** (**add/remove**), adjust scan settings, and review example configurations for typical setups.  

- [**Address List Configuration**](/chester/catalog-applications/chester-wm-bus#address-list-configuration) – **manage and edit** the list of linked wM-Bus **addresses**  
- [**Scan Configuration**](/chester/catalog-applications/chester-wm-bus#scan-configuration) – **adjust scan settings** for device communication 
- [**Example Configurations**](/chester/catalog-applications/chester-wm-bus#example-configurations) – reference **templates** for typical setups

## Message Encryption and Key Management

The **transmitted messages are encrypted** to optimize energy consumption during data transmission, which extends the overall battery life.

The **received data must therefore be decrypted**, which is done using **decryption keys**.  
To achieve this, there are two options:

- [**Hardwario Cloud**](/chester/catalog-applications/chester-wm-bus#hardwario-cloud--decryption-keys) – tutorial on how to enter and manage decryption keys  
- [**Decryption page**](https://wmbusmeters.org/) – online tool for manual data decryption and analysis
