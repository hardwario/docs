## 4. Verify the Update

1. **System → Packages**:  
   - Click **Check For Updates** — it should now report **up to date** (both versions should match).
2. **System → RouterBOARD**:  
   - Confirm that **Current Firmware** now matches **Upgrade Firmware** — meaning the firmware is successfully updated.
