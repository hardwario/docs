## Before you start

#### What EMBER is 
EMBER is an industrial **LoRaWAN gateway (IoT Hotspot)** based on **MikroTik RBM33G**, designed for outdoor deployments (IP67 enclosure).  
Hardware description: https://docs.hardwario.com/ember/hardware-description/

#### You will need
- EMBER gateway (Hotspot)
- **LoRaWAN antenna** (required)
- Power source:
  - 24 V DC adapter / 24 V DC power supply, or
  - 24 V DC passive PoE via the **WAN** port
- Internet connectivity (WAN and/or LTE, depending on your setup)
- A LoRaWAN backend (EMBER Cloud Service / ChirpStack / TTS / other)


#### Quick links

## 1) Set up your EMBER

#### 1.1 Attach antennas (important)
- **Attach the LoRaWAN antenna before powering on.**
- If your unit includes LTE, it may use **two LTE antennas** (internal/external depending on configuration).

More details: https://docs.hardwario.com/ember/hardware-description/#antennas

#### 1.2 Power the gateway
EMBER can be powered by:
- **24 V DC power adapter**
- **24 V DC power supply**
- **24 V DC passive PoE** through the **WAN Ethernet port**

More details: https://docs.hardwario.com/ember/hardware-description/#power-supply-options

#### 1.3 Outdoor mounting safety note
:::danger

For outdoor installations, **EMBER Hotspot** has to be mounted with connectors facing down.

## 2) Connect for local access

EMBER runs **MikroTik RouterOS**.  
For initial access and management, use the WAN interface (leftmost RJ-45 port) and standard RouterOS tools.

**If you don't already have Winbox 4 installed, follow the [Winbox 4 Installation guide](/ember/mikrotik/winbox4-installation).**
#### 2.1 Connect to Ember using Winbox 4

After opening the application, look at the list where you should see your **EMBER**.
- If there is more than one device, look at the EMBER board — on its left side there are two ethernet connectors with a sticker on them. On the sticker, find the **MAC address** — a combination of numbers and letters after the text **E01** (for example: **E01: 48:A5:8A:4F:17:A6**).
- Go back to **Winbox** and find the device with the **matching MAC address**. Click on the device in the list to select it.
- Make sure the **jumper** on the board is **removed**. The location of the jumper is shown in the picture below.

## 4) Choose your LoRaWAN backend 

### EMBER Cloud Service (managed backend)

**EMBER Cloud Service** is a fully managed LoRaWAN backend operated by HARDWARIO.  
It is designed for a fast start without the need to run your own infrastructure.

What the service typically provides:
- **ChirpStack** – LoRaWAN Network Server  
- **Node-RED** – data processing, payload decoding, and forwarding  
- Preconfigured connectivity between the gateway, LNS, and integrations

Recommended if you want to **get data from devices quickly** and forward it to applications or dashboards.

### Self-Hosted LoRaWAN Server
If you already run another LoRaWAN server, you can set EMBER to forward packets to your server.

Key note from the official Hotspot Configuration:
- If you **do not use EMBER Cloud service**, use **your LoRaWAN server IP address**
  and you **don't need to configure VPN tunnels**.

Reference: https://docs.hardwario.com/ember/hotspot-configuration/

## 5) Summary checklist

- LoRaWAN antenna attached (required)
- Power connected (24 V DC or 24 V passive PoE via WAN)
- Outdoor installation: connectors facing down
- PC connected to **WAN**, receives DHCP lease, can reach `172.31.255.1` (updated from default)
- RouterOS login works (`admin` / `[your-password]`)
- Initial configuration script completed (Section 3)
- RouterOS updated to latest version
- IoT package installed
- LoRa interface configured (antenna set to uFL)
- Bootloader updated
- Gateway is configured to your backend (EMBER Cloud / ChirpStack / TTS / other)
- In the LoRaWAN server UI, gateway status shows **Last seen / connected**
- You can see uplinks from at least one LoRaWAN device

---

## Troubleshooting (quick)

#### Can't reach `172.31.255.1`
- Make sure you are plugged into the **WAN** port (not LAN). LAN ports are ether2 and ether3 after running the configuration script.
- Ensure your PC is set to DHCP (or set a static IP in `172.31.255.0/24`).
- Check the Ethernet link LEDs.
- If you haven't run the configuration script yet, the default IP might still be `172.31.255.254`.

#### Gateway is powered, but not "seen" in the LoRaWAN server
- Check if the jumper is disabled. Picture is [here](#21-connect-to-ember-using-winbox-4).
- Confirm the gateway's forwarding destination (server address / ports / protocol).
- Verify WAN/LTE Internet connectivity.
- Ensure the IoT package is installed (check with `/system package print`).
- Verify LoRa interface is configured (check with `/iot lora print`).
- If using EMBER Cloud, confirm you are using the provided service URL and correct configuration guidance.

#### Reset device
Unplug the power cable, hold the reset button and plug the power cable back in. After 5 seconds the LED will start blinking, release the button. The reset button location can be found in the image [here](#21-connect-to-ember-using-winbox-4).
