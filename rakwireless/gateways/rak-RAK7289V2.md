## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Hardware Setup
1.  **Antennas:** Connect the LoRa, LTE, and GPS antennas **before** powering on the device to avoid damage.
2.  **SIM Card:** If using cellular, insert the SIM card into the slot inside the waterproof cap.
3.  **Mounting:** Use the included kit to mount the gateway on a pole or wall.

### 2. Power On
* Connect an Ethernet cable from the **PoE injector** (included) to the **ETH** port on the gateway.
* The device will boot up.

### 3. Accessing the Gateway

You can connect to the gateway's local Web UI using one of two methods:

#### WiFi AP Mode (Default)
1. Connect your PC to the Wi-Fi SSID: `RAK7289CV2_XXXX` (where XXXX are the last bytes of the MAC address).
2. No password is required.
3. Open a web browser and go to `192.168.230.1`.

#### Ethernet Mode
1. Connect the gateway's **ETH** port directly to your PC.
2. Set your PC to a static IP (e.g., `169.254.15.100`) to match the gateway's fallback IP (`169.254.15.1`).

### 4. Setting the Mandatory Password

When you first access the gateway, you are required to set a password for the **root** user. The password must meet these criteria:

* At least **12 characters** long
* Includes at least one **special character**
* Includes at least one **number**
* Includes at least one **Latin letter**

:::tip Gateway EUI
Once the password is set, you will be redirected to the **Dashboard**, where you will define your country and region. Copy the **16-character Gateway EUI** displayed there – you will need it for network server registration.
:::

### 5. Internet Connectivity

Before the gateway can communicate with a network server, it needs an internet connection. Navigate to **Network > WAN**:

* **Ethernet:** Plug the ETH port into your router; it uses DHCP by default.
* **WiFi:** Go to **Wi-Fi**, enable the interface, and scan for your local network.
* **Cellular (LTE Models):** If using a SIM card, configure the APN under **Cellular**.

:::warning Cellular Note
If you are not using a SIM card, disable the cellular interface to prevent `SIM_ABSENT` log spam.

## Configuring Work Modes

The gateway supports multiple LoRaWAN work modes. Navigate to **LoRa > Configuration** to select your preferred mode:

### Basics Station (Recommended for TTS)

Select **Basics Station** to connect to The Things Stack:

| Setting | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Basics Station Mode** | LNS Server |
| **Server URL** | `wss://hardwario-com.eu1.cloud.thethings.industries` (Port 8887) |
| **Trust (CA Certificate)** | Upload the [ISRG Root X1 .pem](https://letsencrypt.org/certs/isrgrootx1.pem) file |
| **Client Token** | Paste your TTS API Key |

### Other Available Work Modes

* **Packet Forwarder:** Used for legacy Semtech UDP or ChirpStack MQTT connections.
* **Built-in Network Server:** Allows the gateway to act as its own standalone LNS (ChirpStack).
