# Introduction

The GAUGER is a configurable WiFi/Ethernet device used for counting pulses on up to four galvanically separated digital inputs.

The device hosts a web based user interface used for it’s configuration. It can also be controlled through an HTTP API. The counter values can be read via Modbus TCP.

## Basic Features

- galvanically separated digital inputs
- 10/100 Base-T Ethernet connectivity
- 2.4GHz WiFi (802.11 b/g/n) connectivity
- DIN rail mount
- Modbus TCP server for reading couter values
- Configuration web site
- HTTP based configuration API
- Over-the-air firmware update functionality

## Applications

- Remotely collect values from various electricity, water consumption and gas meters installed in hard-to-reach places
- Connect to infrared gates you can log and monitor the number of people at various transition or transport stations to ensure smooth traffic and operation
- Track the yield on production lines and thus ensure the overall production is always up to speed without downtime
