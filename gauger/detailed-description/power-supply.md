# Power Supply

The device supports two methods of power supply. Either through the onboard Mini USB-B connector (mainly used for development purposes), or through the dedicated power supply pins of the terminal block. The power supply pins accept a voltage between 9V and 36V. A power supply preference system is in place. If both means of power supply are connected at the same time, the device will be powered through the dedicated power supply pins.
