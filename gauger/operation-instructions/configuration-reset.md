# Configuration Reset

It may be desirable to reset the device's configuration to the default state. This can either be done by clicking the **Factory Reset** button in the System tab of the Web UI. This will reset the config and restart the device.

Another method uses the `USER` button to reset the device. To use this method, hold the `USER` button while you restart the device by pressing the `RESET` button. Keep holding the `USER` button while the green LED is on. When it starts rapidly blinking, release the button. The device will restart and reset the configuration. If you keep holding the button, the device will not reset.

Resetting the configuration will not reset the counter values. To do this, click the **Counter Reset** button in the System tab.
