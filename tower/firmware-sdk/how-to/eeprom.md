**EEPROM** is a special kind of memory. It is small (6 KB on [**Core Module**](../../hardware-modules/about-core-module.md) chip) memory with a limited number of **write/erase cycles**. It is **non-volatile memory** - which means that it does not require power to retain stored information. This means that bytes written/stored inside the EEPROM will **stay there until erased/rewritten** (even without the power)

:::info

Donâ€™t be afraid of limited W/E cycles. In standard conditions, the chip guarantees **100 000 cycles**. Remember that those cycles are **Write/Erase**.

Reading from the EEPROM does not count, so it is completely **safe to read** from it as much as you wish.

### EEPROM Size
[**TOWER Core Module**](../../hardware-modules/about-core-module.md) has 6 KB EEPROM included. In case you need to find this value out inside your code, there is a function for this inside the SDK: `size_t twr_eeprom_get_size(void)`

## Read/Write Example

:::info

  In this example, we will write the float value and string to EEPROM immediately after the Core Module boots. With every press of a button, the data will be retrieved from EEPROM and sent to the computer. To test that the memory is persistent you can try to comment both `twr_eeprom_write` lines out (after running the original example once).

  It should still work and the debug should write the same string.

:::

:::note

Please note that some of our modules (currently `twr_radio_*` module only) use a **few last dozens of bytes** in EEPROM. If you use those modules, remember to use the memory addresses from **0 up to 6000**.

This makes sure that no data will be overwritten.

Expected output of the example below.

```bash showLineNumbers
EEPROM size: 6144
Data:
3.141590
hello world!
