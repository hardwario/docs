For storing data from our sensors we like to use **InfluxDB - a time-series database**. As a bridge between **MQTT** and **InfluxDB**, we created a `mqtt2influxdb`. A tool that connects to **InfluxDB** and **MQTT broker** and by user-defined config subscribes to MQTT topics and stores data from messages.

## Set Up MQTT to InfluxDb

To install `mqtt2influxdb` you will just need to put the next command to your command line

```bash
sudo pip3 install --upgrade mqtt2influxdb
```

Next, you will have to create the directory where you will save the config files. To do that, just run the command:

```
sudo mkdir /etc/hardwario
```

To create the configuration file, you can use any text editor, in this tutorial we will use `nano`:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/hardwario/mqtt2influxdb.yml
```

:::tip

In `nano`, you can save changes by pressing the key combination `Ctrl + O` and exit editor by pressing `Ctrl + X`.

:::note

In the section `tags`, you can use identifiers, e.g.: `tags: room: bedroom`

:::

To test if your configuration file works, you can paste the command:

```
mqtt2influxdb -c /etc/hardwario/mqtt2influxdb.yml --test
```

If everything is ok, you can also run the MQTT to InfluxDB as a service, so it runs in the background and after reboot

```
pm2 start `which python3` --name "mqtt2influxdb" -- `which mqtt2influxdb` -c /etc/hardwario/mqtt2influxdb.yml
pm2 save
```
