:::info

This tutorial expects that you have a running [**Visual Studio Code with our HARDWARIO TOWER extension**](./tower-vscode-extension.md) or [**HARDWARIO Code**](./about-hardwario-code.md) installed.

:::

This extension makes it possible to simply **develop**, **flash** and **debug firmware** for **HARDWARIO TOWER**.

The extension has two operating modes:

:::info

In both modes, you should see the **HARDWARIO logo on the side panel**.

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col col--4">
      <div>
        <Image img={require('./hardwario-sidebar-icon.png')}/>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col col--6">
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

:::

- If you have some HARDWARIO TOWER firmware open ([**Firmware Mode**](#firmware-mode))
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col col--4">
      <div><Image img={require('./firmware-mode.png')}/></div>
    </div>
    <div class="col col--6">
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

- If you have anything else or nothing open ([**Basic Mode**](#basic-mode))
  <div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col col--4">
      <div><Image img={require('./basic-mode.png')}/></div>
    </div>
    <div class="col col--6">
    </div>
  </div>
  </div>

## Basic Mode

If you didn’t open a folder with HARDWARIO TOWER firmware the extension will activate but **will provide fewer options**.

You will get access to some basic commands that will lead you to our websites and then two commands for **cloning firmware from our [GitHub](https://github.com/hardwario)**.

You can use these commands to get started with the firmware development.

### From Skeleton Project…

You will be prompted to select a folder where the [**twr-skeleton firmware**](https://github.com/hardwario/twr-skeleton) should be cloned (**A new folder for the firmware will be created**).

After you select the folder you **should name your firmware folder** so you don’t have some collisions with other firmware folders.

### From Existing Project…

You will be provided with a list of existing firmware for HARDWARIO TOWER available on our [**GitHub**](https://github.com/hardwario). You can select any of them based on the **name** and **description** of the firmware.

You will be prompted to select a folder where the selected firmware should be cloned (**A new folder for the firmware will be created**). After you select the folder you can **name your firmware folder** so you don’t have some collisions with other firmware folders.

:::note

After you clone the firmware the window will be **reopened with the firmware folder opened**.

:::

## Firmware Mode

:::tip

If you are using standard firmware, the `/src/application.c` file should be opened at the start so you can start developing right away.

:::

In this mode, you will get some additional controls on the **bottom panel** and the **side panel**.

On the **bottom panel**, there are some important controls that you can quickly use, without the need for the **side panel controls**

<Image img={require('./bottom-panel.png')}/>

#### Device selection `Device: COM3 - bc-core-module`

With this, you will have to select the device that you want to work with. If you have **no HARDWARIO devices connected** there will be a `No Device found!` prompt. If you have multiple devices connected, you can browse through them **by clicking on the text**.

#### Firmware type selection `Firmware type: Debug`

You can choose if you want to build in `Debug` or `Release` mode. For normal development, we recommend using the default `debug` setting because it enables logging.

:::info

There are other icons that you can use which will be described later, with the **commands that they call**.

:::

### Build + Flash (Console)

This command will do the **whole** cycle that you can use while developing**. It will **build the firmware**, **flash it** to the selected device and then **attach the console** for the device to see the log messages.

:::note

You can use this most of the time while developing.

:::

:::info

There is a separate chapter for the [**TOWER Console**](./hardwario-tower-console.md).

:::

### Build + Flash (Debugger)

:::caution

You will need a [**JLink Probe**](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/) for this to work properly. This is for **advanced debugging**. You have to have `arm-none-eabi-gdb` and `JLinkGDBServerCL` in **PATH** for this to work. If you are using our portable version you don’t have to worry about that and you just need the JLink Probe.

:::

This command will not attach the console like the **previous one** but will instead try to attach it to the **JLink debugger** for some **advanced debugging**. You can read more about JLink debugging in the [**Advanced Debugging chapter**](./advanced-debugging.md).

### Clean All Outputs

This command will clean all the outputs so you can recompile **everything from scratch**.

### Build Firmware

This command will run **CMake** and **ninja** on the code. You can check if you have some **errors** or **warnings** in the code before you flash it into the device.

### Flash Firmware

This command will **flash** the firmware onto the **selected device**. It will also run the **build command** in case you didn’t do that before or forgot to rebuild the changes.

### Attach Console

This command will attach the console to the **selected device** so you can view the **log messages**.

:::info

There is a separate chapter for the [**TOWER Console**](./hardwario-tower-console.md).

:::

### Attach Debugger

:::caution

You will need a [**JLink Probe**](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/) for this to work properly. This is for advanced debugging. You have to have `arm-none-eabi-gdb` and `JLinkGDBServerCL` in **PATH** for this to work. If you are using our portable version you don’t have to worry about that and you just need the JLink Probe.

:::

This command will try to connect to a JLink for advanced debugging.

You can read more about JLink debugging in the [**Advanced Debugging chapter**](./advanced-debugging.md).

Debugging can be started in **multiple ways**:

#### Press the F5 button with some *.c or *.h file in focus

:::info

There shouldn't be `launch.json` present in the `.vscode` folder.

:::

If you want to just run the debug and not change anything in the `launch.json` you can just press **F5** and select TOWER Debugger. Debugging should start with no problem
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col col--8">
      <div><Image img={require('./start-debugger.png')}/></div>
    </div>
    <div class="col col--2">
    </div>
  </div>
  </div>

#### Go to the Run and Debug and create `launch.json`

If you want to have your custom `launch.json` you can go to the **Run and Debug** window on the **side panel** and **click create a launch.json** file and select TOWER Debugger. or add this configuration to an existing one.

```json showLineNumbers
{
    "name": "HARDWARIO TOWER Debug",
    "request": "launch",
    "type": "cortex-debug",
    "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
    "device": "STM32L083CZ",
    "servertype": "jlink",
    "jlinkscript": "./sdk/tools/jlink/flash.jlink",
    "interface": "swd",
    "serverpath": "${command:hardwario-tower.locate_jlink}",
    "svdFile": "./sdk/sys/svd/stm32l0x3.svd",
    "gdbPath": "${command:hardwario-tower.locate_toolchain}",
    "runToEntryPoint": "application_init",
    "executable": "${workspaceFolder}/out/debug/firmware.elf",
    "windows": {
        "gdbPath": "${command:hardwario-tower.locate_toolchain}.exe",
        "serverpath": "${command:hardwario-tower.locate_jlink}.exe"
    }
}
```
#### Press Attach Debugger in the HARDWARIO Extension command palette

You can use this option if you don’t want to worry about `launch.json` or any other options mentioned before. Just select the **HARDWARIO logo on the side panel** and select **Attach Debugger** or **Build + Flash (Debugger)** option.
