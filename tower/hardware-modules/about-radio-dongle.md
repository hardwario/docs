        The Radio Dongle is the main element of the HARDWARIO radio network. This product works as a gateway for the HARWDARIO nodes. It looks like a USB stick. You can plug it into your desktop, Raspberry Pi, or Turris Omnia. Also, you can look at it as an access point for up to 32 HARDWARIO TOWER nodes.
