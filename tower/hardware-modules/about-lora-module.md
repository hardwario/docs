        The <b>LoRa Module</b> allows you to communicate to the <b>LoRaWAN wireless network</b>, a network made for the IoT. This technology makes it possible to communicate from a battery-powered device directly to a server, even for several years. The LoRa Module uses <b>radio frequency 868 MHz</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks to specific zig-zag modulation, the LoRa device can communicate with the gateway over a distance of tens of kilometers.
      </p>
      <p>
        This network has a wide range of applications. Its use is particularly useful in energy consumption meters (e.g. water meters, gas meters, etc.), environmental sensors (e.g. a CO₂ sensor), and also in applications for early reports of accidents or defects (e.g. water leak detector).
