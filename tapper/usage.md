## Configuration

The TAPPER configuration file uses YAML syntax.

### MQTT

- Host is the host with the MQTT broker. At least this is required.
- Port is the port with the exposed MQTT broker.

```yaml
mqtt:
  host: "your_host"
  port: 1883
  tls:
    cafile: "/path/to/file"
    certfile: "/path/to/file"
    keyfile: "/path/to/file"
```

#### TLS

To set up TLS, refer to [TLS Setup](tls-setup).

- Cafile is the path to the CA file to verify the server certificate with. (The signing CA)
- Certfile is the path to the client certificate file, signed by the CA.
- Keyfile is the path to the client key file.

:::warning[MQTT Server Certificate]

The **MQTT host** must **match** the **CN** or one of the **SANs** specified in the **server** X509 certificate.

See [MQTT TLS Setup](tls-setup)

:::

### WiFi

- WiFi can be set up either in static or in dynamic mode.

:::tip

The `passphrase` field can have the `psk` value acquired from `wpa_passphrase`.

:::

#### Dynamic

Dynamic mode uses DHCP and sets the address, gateway, and DNS servers automatically.

```yaml
wifi:
  network: "MyWiFiSSID"
  passphrase: "supersecretpassword"
  mode: "dynamic"
```

#### Static

In static mode you have to set everything manually.

```yaml
wifi:
  network: "MyWiFiSSID"
  passphrase: "supersecretpassword"
  mode: "static"
  address: "192.168.1.100/24"
  gateway: "192.168.1.1"
  nameservers:
  - 8.8.8.8
  - 1.1.1.1
```

The address can have a prefix length or a netmask attached, as shown in the example.

### Example

An example config file in `/home/hardwario/tapper.conf`:

```yaml
mqtt:
  host: "10.0.0.150"
  port: 8883
  tls:
    cafile: "/home/hardwario/ca.crt"
    certfile: "/home/hardwario/client.crt"
    keyfile: "/home/hardwario/client.key"
wifi:
  network: "MyWiFiSSID"
  passphrase: "supersecretpassword"
  mode: "static"
  address: "192.168.1.100/24"
  gateway: "192.168.1.1"
  nameservers:
  - 8.8.8.8
  - 1.1.1.1
```

This would be used with: `sudo tapper run -c /home/hardwario/tapper.conf`
