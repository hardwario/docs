# Getting Started

The **HARDWARIO STICKER** acts as an end device in a LoRaWAN network.  
Therefore, it needs to be added into the **ChirpStack system**, together with a gateway (for example, **EMBER**).

In the following link, you can find a **step-by-step guide** on how to install the entire system, add your STICKER device into **ChirpStack**, and set up your LoRaWAN network.
