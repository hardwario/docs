# Power Management


STICKER is designed for ultra-low power operation to enable long lifetime in the field without external power sources.  
It is powered by **two standard AA batteries**, which provide a compact and widely available energy source.  

### Energy Harvesting via NFC
- Thanks to its **NFC interface**, STICKER can be configured even when batteries are not inserted or depleted.  
- The NFC field from a smartphone provides enough energy (**energy harvesting**) to write configuration data into the internal EEPROM of the NFC tag.  
- When the device wakes up on battery power, it validates the configuration, applies it, and clears the temporary storage.  

### Optimized Consumption
The STM32WL System-on-Chip enables **ultra-low power operation**, making STICKER suitable for long-term battery-powered deployments.  
Combined with efficient onboard power management, the device is designed to achieve very long lifetime in the field.
