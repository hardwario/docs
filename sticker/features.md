:::info Firmware v1.4.0
The features highlighted on this page are new in the upcoming **STICKER firmware v1.4.0**. The baseline they build on — battery-powered operation with interval telemetry — already exists in v1.3.x.

# Firmware Features

This page describes notable behaviors of the STICKER firmware: how the device manages power, keeps its LoRaWAN connection healthy, and protects stored data. For the shell commands and configuration parameters that control these behaviors, see [**Developer Access**](developer-mode.md).

## Data retention

### Identity and provisioning are preserved

A reset or firmware update must never un-provision a field device. The device identity (serial number, secret key, claim token) and the full LoRaWAN provisioning (DevEUI, JoinEUI, keys, DevAddr, session keys, region, sub-band, network, activation, ADR) are a protected set that survives every reset path: `settings reset`, the over-the-air `factory_reset` command, an NFC config reset, and config-schema migration on a firmware update. Only the local, shell-only `settings erase` wipes them.

### Pulse counters persist across power loss

The hall and input pulse totalizers are saved to flash and restored on boot, so a battery swap, brownout, or reset no longer resets a metering total to zero.

### Sensor history (store-and-forward)

When enabled, the device records sensor readings to flash and can replay a requested time window over LoRaWAN. Stored records survive power loss. See [**Sensor History**](developer-access/sensor-history.md) for the configuration and commands.

## Operating and power modes

STICKER runs for months on two AA cells. On a provisioned device the firmware samples the sensors and sends LoRaWAN uplinks on the configured intervals, sleeping between them. In addition, two special states further reduce power draw.

### Radio-silent mode (unprovisioned device)

If the configured **DevEUI is all-zero** (a device that has never been provisioned), the firmware does not try to join a network. It enters a **`DISABLED`** state and skips the entire LoRaWAN bring-up: the radio stack is never started and the sub-GHz radio is never powered, so there is no join traffic and no radio burst at boot. This prevents a blank device from draining its battery on join attempts that cannot succeed.

The device stays radio-silent until it is given a real DevEUI (and the rest of the LoRaWAN keys) and **rebooted**. On a developer console, `ats lrw status` reports `DISABLED`.

:::tip
A device can be provisioned over NFC while powered off. See the [**NFC Configurator APP**](nfc-configurator-app/setup.md). After writing the keys, the device leaves radio-silent mode on its next boot.

### Debug deep-sleep (auto-suspend)

A **debug** build keeps the CPU awake so the RTT console stays reachable, which steadily drains the battery. To protect a forgotten bench unit, the debug firmware enters **deep sleep** (STM32 Shutdown) after a configurable idle period with no shell activity (`CONFIG_APP_DEBUG_AUTOSUSPEND_S`, default `7200` seconds, 2 hours; `0` disables it).

- Any shell input resets the idle timer; the `power suspend` command enters deep sleep on demand.
- Wake is by **NRST or a power cycle**, which is a clean boot. The stored identity and LoRaWAN keys survive; RAM state and the wall clock are re-established (time re-syncs from the network).
- The **release** build is unaffected; it already sleeps between activity through normal power management.

## LoRaWAN connection management

The firmware supervises the LoRaWAN link and recovers from outages on its own:

- It requests a link check periodically (every Nth uplink, set by `config lrw-link-check-interval`).
- A single missed answer is tolerated; only repeated failures while the link is degraded escalate to an OTAA **rejoin**, after `config lrw-link-check-fail-rejoin` further failures. Rejoin attempts back off between tries.
- **ABP** devices cannot rejoin (they never join), so they stay in a degraded state instead.

This replaces an earlier failure mode where the device could stop transmitting after a few messages.

---

## Sensor reliability

Sensor readings are range-checked before they reach telemetry, history, or alarms, so a glitchy sample does not raise a false alarm or skew stored data. A configured sensor that stops producing valid readings raises an alarm, so a silently failed sensor is surfaced instead of being reported as missing data indefinitely.

---

## Real-time clock

The device keeps wall-clock time, synchronized from the network on join (LoRaWAN `DeviceTimeReq`) and optionally set from a phone over NFC. It is used to timestamp sensor-history records and alarm events.
