# STICKER Quick Start Guide

Welcome! This page helps you **power up (revive)** your STICKER and choose what to do next:
- connect it to **ChirpStack**,
- connect it to **The Things Stack (TTS)**,
- or use **your own LoRaWAN network**
---

## Before you start

#### What STICKER is

**STICKER** is an open IoT platform based on STM32WL with integrated LoRaWAN connectivity. It is a compact, battery-powered device with long lifetime and ready-to-use applications such as STICKER Clime, Input, and Motion, making it ideal for flexible sensor deployments.

For detailed technical specifications of the hardware, please refer to the [**Hardware Description**](https://docs.hardwario.com/sticker/hardware-description/) page.

#### You will need
- **STICKER device** (Clime / Input / Motion)
- **2× AA batteries**
- A **LoRaWAN gateway** within range (your own or a public network gateway)
- A **LoRaWAN Network Server** (ChirpStack / TTS / other)

#### Useful links

## 1) Identify your STICKER variant

STICKER ships with a ready-to-use “catalog application”:

- **STICKER Clime** — temperature & humidity monitoring  
  https://docs.hardwario.com/sticker/catalog-applications/sticker-clime/

- **STICKER Input** — external sensors + analog/digital inputs (1‑Wire, dry contact, 0–24 V analog)  
  https://docs.hardwario.com/sticker/catalog-applications/sticker-input/

- **STICKER Motion** — ultra‑low‑power PIR motion detection  
  https://docs.hardwario.com/sticker/catalog-applications/sticker-motion/

Catalog overview:  
https://docs.hardwario.com/sticker/catalog-applications/catalog-applications/

---

## 2) Set up your STICKER

1. **Open the enclosure** and access the battery holder.
2. **Insert two AA cells** (check polarity).
3. STICKER will boot and the **status LED** indicates activity.
4. For the first test, place the device **close to your LoRaWAN gateway** (best RF conditions).
5. Wait for the first uplink (the timing depends on the installed catalog app and reporting interval).

#### NFC note (optional, but useful)
STICKER is **NFC-ready** and can be configured even when batteries are not inserted (NFC energy harvesting).
This is useful for provisioning LoRaWAN settings before installation:
- STICKER Power Management: https://docs.hardwario.com/sticker/power-management/

:::info
A HARDWARIO provisioning and configuration application using NFC is currently under development.

## 3) Choose your LoRaWAN backend

### ChirpStack v4
Best if you want a private LoRaWAN network you control.

Start here (HARDWARIO guide):
- **https://docs.hardwario.com/sticker/lorawan-network-server/lorawan-chirpstack**

Step-by-step sections:
- Installation: https://docs.hardwario.com/apps/chirpstack/chirpstack-installation
- Gateways: https://docs.hardwario.com/apps/chirpstack/chirpstack-configuration/chirpstack-gateways
- End devices: https://docs.hardwario.com/apps/chirpstack/chirpstack-configuration/chirpstack-end-devices
- Payload decoding: https://docs.hardwario.com/apps/chirpstack/chirpstack-configuration/chirpstack-decoding
- STICKER **Decoder**: https://github.com/hardwario/sticker-firmware/blob/main/app/decoder/ttn.js

---

### The Things Stack
Best if you want to use TTS (managed or self-hosted), including TTN/TTI workflows.

Start here (HARDWARIO guide):
- **https://docs.hardwario.com/sticker/lorawan-network-server/lorawan-tts**

Step-by-step sections:
- Gateways: https://docs.hardwario.com/apps/the-things-stack/tts-configuration/tts-gateways
- End devices: https://docs.hardwario.com/apps/the-things-stack/tts-configuration/tts-end-devices
- STICKER **Decoder**: https://github.com/hardwario/sticker-firmware/blob/main/app/decoder/ttn.js

---

## 5) Configure the device (optional)

STICKER can be configured to adjust reporting intervals, set alarm thresholds, or change LoRaWAN keys.

Configuration is available via two methods:
- **NFC** — configure with a smartphone, no tools needed (NFC app under development)
- **Shell (RTT terminal)** — for developers via a debug connection

For a full list of all configuration parameters and commands, see:

**[Configuration →](configuration)**

---

## 6) Next steps (after first successful uplink)

At this point, your STICKER is connected, data is arriving, and dashboards are working.

Typical next steps:

- **Install the device in its final location** and verify long-term LoRaWAN coverage.
- **Observe data for several hours or days** to confirm stability and expected update intervals.
- **Adjust reporting behavior** — see [**Configuration**](https://docs.hardwario.com/sticker/configuration/) to tune sample and report intervals.
- **Set alerts or thresholds** in your dashboard platform or using STICKER's built-in alarm feature.

#### STICKER Input wiring (Input variant only)

If you are using **STICKER Input**, refer to the wiring and DIP switch configuration guide:
- https://docs.hardwario.com/sticker/sticker-input-wiring/sticker-input-wiring/

## Developer / customization path (optional)
If you want to modify behavior or build custom firmware:
- Developer Access (Debug Mode): https://docs.hardwario.com/sticker/developer-mode/
- Open firmware repository: https://github.com/hardwario/sticker-firmware/

---

## Troubleshooting checklist
- **No uplinks?**
  - Check battery polarity / replace batteries
  - Move closer to a gateway (RF coverage)
  - Verify frequency plan and device profile in your NS
  - Verify keys / activation method required by your firmware
  - Check payload decoder settings
