## Typical use cases

#### Smart monitoring for material quality

- Monitoring temperature and humidity during material storage and usage is crucial in processes like plastic injection molding. Moisture from temperature differences can cause granulate condensation, leading to final product porosity. Long-term monitoring helps uncover these hidden issues.

#### Reliable monitoring for medicine storage

- Storing medicine requires precise environmental control. Any significant change in temperature or humidity must be reported immediately. Large storage areas often demand multiple sensors to ensure complete and reliable coverage.

#### Protecting patients with smart sensing

- With rising global temperatures and more climate extremes, maintaining stable conditions in hospital rooms is critical. A failing air conditioner - or even an open window - can put patients at risk. Temperature and humidity sensors in each room enable early warnings and better care.
