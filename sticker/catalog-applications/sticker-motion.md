## Typical use cases

#### Optimizing movement in industrial spaces
- Monitoring aisles in industrial spaces helps optimize logistics routes for material flow and finished products. It reduces downtime and minimizes safety risks caused by overcrowded paths and unpredictable movement.

#### Smarter store layouts with motion data
- In retail, knowing where customers move -and how often - transforms store layout planning and boosts sales. With STICKER Motion, you can track aisle traffic and identify high-traffic areas to optimize product placement and enhance the shopping experience.

#### Smarter comfort in busy spaces
- The average person emits about 100â€¯W of heat per hour. In places with high foot traffic, like waiting rooms, monitoring motion, temperature, and humidity helps maintain comfort and efficiency. STICKER Motion captures all three for smarter climate control.
