In the Variables section, you can upload **decryption keys** used to decode data when encryption is applied. Some transmitted data may be encrypted to ensure secure or efficient communication, in which case decryption keys are required to make the data readable. This section explains how to add individual decryption keys to the Cloud through the Variables section.
