# Tags

Tags are used to **group devices** with **different firmware** or **functionality**. You can filter on tags in your space.

Tags are also crucial with **Connectors**. The same tag connects device(s) and connector(s), so the device message calls the connector handler.

Tags are defined by its **name** and **color**.

For proper naming, follow [**Naming Conventions**](./index.md#naming-conventions).
