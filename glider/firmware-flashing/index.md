# Firmware Flashing

GLIDER firmware can be updated in two ways:

- [**Over USB-C**](application-over-at.md) - no debug probe required. Recommended for production units and field updates.
- [**Over J-Link (SWD)**](application-over-j-link.md) - requires a J-Link probe. Used during firmware development.

Both methods end with the same result: a new application image running on the nRF9151. Pick the path that matches what hardware you have on hand.
