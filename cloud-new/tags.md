# Tags

Tags are **named labels with a color** that you assign to both devices and connectors. They are the glue that connects devices to connectors — a message from a device is forwarded only to connectors that share at least one tag with that device.

## Why Tags?

Tags let you route messages flexibly without hardcoding device IDs anywhere:

- One device → multiple connectors (assign multiple tags)
- Many devices → one connector (assign the same tag to all of them)
- Separate environments: `production` tag vs `dev` tag, each connected to a different endpoint

## Creating a Tag

1. Go to **Tags** in the left sidebar
2. Click **+ NEW TAG**
3. Enter a name following the [naming conventions](/cloud-new/#naming-conventions)
4. Pick a color (used for visual identification in device lists and connector views)
5. Click **Create**

## Assigning Tags

Tags can be assigned in two places:

- **Device detail → Tags tab** — assign tags to a device
- **Connector settings** — select which tags the connector listens to

A device with no tags assigned will not trigger any connector.

## Access Type

Tags have an `access_type` field:

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| `write` | Full access — tag can be used for both reading messages and sending downlinks |
| `read` | Read-only — tag can receive messages but cannot be used for downlinks |

## Example Setup

```
Tag: "temperature-sensors"

  Device: chester-floor-1  ──[temperature-sensors]──▶  Connector: my-backend
  Device: chester-floor-2  ──[temperature-sensors]──▶  Connector: my-backend
  Device: chester-floor-3  ──[temperature-sensors]──▶  Connector: my-backend
```

All three devices share the same tag, so all their messages are forwarded to `my-backend` via the connector.
