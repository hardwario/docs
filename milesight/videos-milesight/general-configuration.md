# Milesight - General Configuration

This video focuses on **device configuration via NFC using a mobile phone** and the **Milesight ToolBox** application.

While a smartphone is used as an example in this tutorial, configuration can also be performed using the **[Milesight Field Tester FT101](https://docs.hardwario.com/milesight/utility/milesight-ft101)**.
