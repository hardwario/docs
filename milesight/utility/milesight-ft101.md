## Retrieving Device Keys

First, identify the unique identification credentials of your FT101.

1. Power on the device and open the **Field Tester** application
2. **If the device is NOT registered**: The Device EUI and Application Key will be visible on the home screen
3. Navigate to **Settings > LoRaWAN Settings** to record the **Application EUI** (8-bit code, sometimes labeled as Join EUI)
4. **If the device IS registered**: Go to **Settings > Basic Information** to find:
   - **Device EUI** (8-bit code)
   - **Application Key** (16-bit encryption key)

:::info
The **AppEUI** (Join EUI) is fixed: **24E124C0002A0001**

**DevEUI** (Device Extended Unique Identifier) is unique for each device and can be found printed on the device label.

## Device Configuration

Before connecting to the network, ensure the local settings are correct.

1. Navigate to **LoRaWAN Settings** in the Field Tester app
2. **Frequency Plan**: Select **EU868** (standard for Europe/Czech Republic)
3. **Save**: Tap the Save button to apply changes

**Additional Configuration Options**
- Configurable **Tx power**, **reporting interval** (6-60s), **frequency band**, and **spreading factor**
- **Mock sensor mode** to simulate different Milesight devices
- GPS coordinate recording during field tests

---

## LNS Registration (Server-Side)

This process occurs within your LoRaWAN Network Server interface (e.g., TTN, ChirpStack, or Milesight IoT Cloud).

### Registration Steps

1. **Create Application**: Create a folder or container (e.g., "Field_Testing")
2. **Add Device**:
   - **Name**: Assign a label (e.g., FT101-Tester)
   - **Device EUI**: Enter the code retrieved from the tester
3. **Connection Settings**:
   - **Join Mode**: Select OTAA
   - **LoRaWAN Version**: Select v1.0.3
   - **Regional Parameters Revision**: Select RP001 Regional Parameters 1.0.3
4. **Insert Keys**: Paste the App EUI (Join EUI) and App Key from the retrieval step
5. **Confirmed Data**: Ensure the server is set to respond to confirmed uplinks (enabled by default on standard LNS)
6. **Save**: Confirm the registration in the LNS

For information about supported LoRaWAN network server platforms, see 👉[**LoRaWAN Network Options**](https://docs.hardwario.com/milesight/utility/index#lorawan-network-options)

## Network Activation (Join)

Monitor the **Network Status** in the top bar of the home screen.

- **Success**: Status changes to "Connected"
- **Troubleshooting**: If the device still displays "Not connected to the gateway" after several minutes:
  - Restart the application (press the center button to open the task manager and close the app)
  - **Distance**: Verify you are within gateway range via the LNS logs
  - **Key Errors**: Check for typos in the App Key (e.g., confusing '0' with 'O')
  - **Antenna**: Ensure the LoRa antenna is securely tightened

## Core Functions

| Function | Description | Objective |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Real-time Testing** | Displays instant RSSI and SNR values for your current position | Immediate verification of network status at your exact location |
| **Signal Evaluation** | Tests various combinations of Data Rate (DR) and Spreading Factor (SF7–SF12) | Identifying the most stable SF/DR settings for reliable operation |
| **Noise Scan** | Scans the spectrum (863–870 MHz) to measure background radio interference | Identifying "radio smog" that could block sensor communication |
| **Coverage Mapping** | GPS-tracked signal quality mapping | Identifying optimal deployment locations |
| **Ping-pong Simulation** | Simulates bidirectional communication | Testing downlink capabilities |

### Testing Features

- Multiple testing modes: signal quality (RSSI/SNR), coverage mapping, noise scanning, ping-pong simulation
- Test results stored on 64GB internal storage
- Exportable via USB Type-C or microSD card (up to 256GB)
- Insert a **microSD card** to automatically save measurement results to a CSV file for PC analysis

## Interpreting Noise Scan Results

A lower RSSI value (more negative) indicates a cleaner environment.

| RSSI Value | Environment | Recommendation |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| -110 dBm to -120 dBm | Excellent / Clean | Ideal for gateway installation |
| -90 dBm to -100 dBm | Moderate Interference | Functional, but range may be reduced |
| Higher than -85 dBm | Heavy Interference | Critical. Relocate gateway or change frequency |

## Additional Capabilities

**Milesight ToolBox** can be installed to configure other Milesight sensors via built-in **NFC reader** (ISO/IEC 14443A, 1-3 cm reading distance).

**Initial Setup**
- Connect to **Wi-Fi** and enable **Location Services** in Android Settings
- Grant location permission to Field Tester App for GPS tracking
