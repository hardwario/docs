## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up ThingsBoard and start monitoring your devices from scratch.

---

### 1. Create a Device in ThingsBoard

Start by logging into [ThingsBoard](https://app.hardwario.cloud/) and creating a new device.
This device will act as the endpoint that receives and stores data sent from HARDWARIO Cloud.

👉 [Adding a New Device](creating-device)

---

### 2. Connect to HARDWARIO Cloud

Go to [HARDWARIO Cloud](https://hardwario.cloud/) and set up a Connector that points to your ThingsBoard device.
This connector will securely transmit your device data from HARDWARIO Cloud to ThingsBoard.

👉 [Connecting to ThingsBoard](cloud-connection)

---

### 3. Create a Dashboard

Once the connection is established and data is flowing, create a dashboard in ThingsBoard.
Add widgets such as cards, charts, and gauges to visualize your data in real time.

👉 [Creating a Dashboard](creating-dashboard)

---

### 4. Set Up User Roles and Groups

ThingsBoard lets you precisely control what each user can see and do.
Define roles with specific permissions and organize users into groups tied to their devices and dashboards.

👉 [User Management](users-managing)

---

### 5. Add Users

Create user accounts, assign them to groups, and send activation links so your customers can log in and access their dashboards.

👉 [Adding Users](users)

---

### 6. Share a Dashboard via Public Link

Generate a read-only public URL for any dashboard and share it with clients or stakeholders — no login required.
